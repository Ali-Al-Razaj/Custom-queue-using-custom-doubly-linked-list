# Custom Queue Using Custom Doubly Linked List

This project implements a custom queue data structure built upon a user-defined doubly linked list in C++. It serves as an educational example to understand how fundamental data structures like queues and linked lists operate under the hood.

## Features

- **Custom Doubly Linked List (clsDblLinkedList)**: A templated class that provides the foundation for the queue, supporting operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and reversal.

- **Custom Queue (clsMyQueue)**: A queue implementation that utilizes the custom doubly linked list to perform enqueue and dequeue operations, adhering to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.


## File Structure

- **clsDblLinkedList.h**: Contains the definition and implementation of the doubly linked list class.

- **clsMyQueue.h**: Defines the queue class that uses the doubly linked list for its operations.

- **Custom Queue.cpp**: The main source file demonstrating the usage of the custom queue.

- **Custom Queue.sln, Custom Queue.vcxproj, Custom Queue.vcxproj.filters**: Project files for building the application using Visual Studio.
